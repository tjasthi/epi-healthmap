## Inspiration
Resource Mapping Healthcare Screening
Physicians traditionally rely on patient reports and medical records when performing their diagnosis. However, a patient’s medical conditions and treatment options can wildly vary depending on a variety of factors including living environment, race, regional statistics and socioeconomic status. Often, physicians do not assess the impact of the patient’s living environment on health outcomes. As a result, physicians defer to following a standard protocol rather than personalizing the care. This leads to unnecessary expenses and reduced quality and accuracy of care for the patient. 

## What it does
We want to create a resource map that can overlay with Google Maps, so when a patient’s zip code is referenced, certain health metrics will populate and can be cross referenced with epidemiological data that are relevant for that patient’s personalized care. Eg: inputting a pediatric patient’s age and zip code to determine if this child lives in an area where they should be lead tested.

## How we built it
We built this by creating an HTML file that utilizes Google Map's API so we could create a heatmap overlay. Once we received an API Key, we compressed and organized data points of latitude and longitude that related to topical medical concerns. We collected this data from the department of Public Health of Maryland and presented it in a manner to demonstrate geographical trends in disease.

## Challenges we ran into
The biggest challenge was thinking of how to overlay a heatmap of data points. It took a while to figure out how to find an API key and what language we wanted to use. Initially, we tried to use an android app and emulator, but we realized this task would much better be accomplished via HTML.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud to have figured out and learn HTML. It was exciting to learn such an applicable skill in such a short amount of time.

## What we learned
We learned basic HTML and how to use APIs to help with various projects.

## What's next for Health-Code Map:
We can further this project by addressing more epidemiological issues specific to other states and regions of the country. In the future, we may be able to apply this worldwide with risk factors for many types of health concerns. In addition, we can add more features that can enhance the user interface and experience by displaying evidence based healthcare suggestions with the data presented to further augment healthcare provider decision-making.
